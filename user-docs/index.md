# **Project Details**

Project entails the seamless integration of cQube with Unified Communication Interface (UCI) services, ensuring businesses receive real-time notifications tailored to their preferences. The implementation includes the development of a foundational Message Generation system with threshold checks and efficient message queue handling. Additionally, a Message Routing Service is being crafted to optimize communication by intelligently routing messages according to predefined topics and recipients. Concurrently, the project involves the setup and deployment of the UCI service within cQube, providing businesses with a robust communication framework. Moreover, a User Registration System is being implemented, allowing users to subscribe to topics with personalized preferences and tracking essential statistics for enhanced insights. The project is being developed using the Django framework, ensuring a scalable and secure solution. The project is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with a focus on delivering a robust and user-friendly communication system for businesses.
